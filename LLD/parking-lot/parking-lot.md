Design a parking lot system that supports:
1. Multiple levels/floors
2. Multiple types of parking spots (for cars, bikes, trucks)
3. Parking and un-parking of vehicles
4. Finding the nearest available spot
5. Real-time availability tracking

Functional Requirements
1. A vehicle can enter and park in the nearest available spot.
2. A vehicle can exit and free the spot
3. Support multiple vehicle types: Car, Bike, Truck
4. Support different spot sizes: Small, Medium, Large
5. Ability to query available spots by type or floor

Non-functional Requirements
1. Thread-safety (in real-world, but can skip for now)
2. Scalable design
3. Clean object-oriented structure
